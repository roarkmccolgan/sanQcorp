Turbine Hall had been experiencing vast amounts of water ingress through the cracks of the basement car park and was causing extensive damage to the cars below. As such the waterproofing of this basement was to be done quickly, professionally and without too much interruption. Normal waterproofing membranes were not an option as this would mean to remove the paving above the basement car park and would end up being too costly. Solution With Sanika Waterproofing specialists being the approved applicators for Kryton in Southern Africa they were awarded the project to repair the basement car park using the Kryton Krystol Crack Repair System. As an official heritage site, Turbine Hall offers a unique and exclusive office park for Anglo Gold Ashanti and The Forum Company. A strict working schedule was followed to ensure minimal disruption to the site including weekend and evening work.

As this site is a heritage site they needed to ensure that they could waterproofing the structure without having to remove or damage any of the existing plantation and vegetation. They therefore needed a product that could waterproof the structure from the negative side while still maintaining its integrity. Solution The Kryton Crystalline concrete waterproofing technology was the only of its kind that could offer a solution whereby the damaged structure could be waterproofed and rejuvenated from the negative side that was cost effective and would ensure longevity to the structure. The Kryton Crack repair system was used to complete this job. In order to minimise disruption to the site Sanika worked at night and on weekends ensuring minimal disruption to the tenant SAB Miller and the heritage site.

Because of the nature of this process, the reservoir could not be emptied for this repair process as not only would it stagnate their smelting process but it would incur enormous labour and operational costs. Therefore, repairs would have to be to the negative side. Impala had numerous contractors come and do a test panel on the negative side of the structure to see if their solution would work for this extremely large 6m (20 ft) deep reservoir structure. Kryton was the only successful product on these test panels, as such, Sanika Waterproofing were awarded the contract to repair and waterproof this structure using Kryton’s Crack Repair System. Solution Sanika had to remove the unsuccessful membranes and other products from the structure to prepare it for the crack repair and waterproofing process. After preparing the surface Sanika had to act quickly with Krystol Plug as the water penetrating through the cracks was at a temp of over 80 C° (176 F°). After the Krystol Plug successfully stopped the flow of water Sanika employed the rest of the Krystol Crack Repair System followed by a coat of Krystol T1 & T2 to completely waterproof the reservoir. Impala was pleased with the work and had this to say; “Sanika performed the work in an exemplary fashion, with due respect to all safety, environmental and quality aspects. The work was executed within budget and on time with a very high standard of quality.” Subsequent inspections where conducted by an independent consulting engineer appointed by Impala. The engineers determined that the Kryton solution is long term and of superior quality.

The newly constructed reservoirs had severe leaks and flaws through the joints, cold joints, tie holes and through the concrete.  These reservoirs are a vital water source for the people in this rural area and therefore a complete waterproofing solution was required. Due to the value of water in these areas Masetlaoka Scott Wilson made the informed decision to award Sanika with the contract to perform Kryton’s Krystol Crack Repair and T1 and T2 slurry waterproofing systems to render this reservoir completely waterproof. Solution Due to the inadequate construction of the reservoirs it was determined that a waterproofing solution was required before they were commissioned for use. Sanika’s solution was to use Kryton’s Krystol Crack Repair System, consisting of Krytsol T1 and T2 as well as Krystol Bari-Cote, on the cold joints and tie holes where water penetration was evident form the flood tests. The Reservoir has now been commissioned for use with no leaks and is supplying our most precious resource “water” to this rural area.
